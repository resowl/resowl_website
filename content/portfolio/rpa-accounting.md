An Automation Solution was developed for an “Asset Management System” utilized by the energy industry.


An asset management system was developed to track all the transactions associated with every asset purchased or sold by a perticular accounting unit. Accouting team can configure 
various recurssive charges and taxes associated with a perticular asset. Depending on the life of an asset, accouting team needs to perform monthly calculations for all the operational assets
in the unit. 

Challenge: Monthy operation carried out by the accounting team was time consuming and error prone. 

Solution: We developed a robust bot capable of performing month end operations on behalf of the accounting team. A framework was designed in such a way that the it covers the user acceptance testing for the application on the same code base. The framework had capabilities to generate execution report, rollback on failure as well an built in alert engine for sending out execution alerts. A dashboard was also provided on the application side to help client monitor the bot operation status.
