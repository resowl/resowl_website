The “Inventory Automation” solution was built for a jewelry e-commerce. 


issue: Client was selling verious products on multiple platforms. These includes their own website and other 3rd party online portals. Since sales were happening parallely on multiple platoforms simultaniously, managing inventory became a time consuming process with time. Existing solution was a spreadsheet which was very difficult to maintain and error prone. 

Solution: A dynamic desktop based tool was developed to perform all the inventory related operations. Tool was capable of creating various reports for clients which was consumed by their operations team and the manufacturing team. All the reports were exported as a spreadsheet which saved a lot of training time for the existing users. Client was able to save significant amount of time using this tool.
